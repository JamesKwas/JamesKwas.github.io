<p class="text">Hi, I'm James. Of course you know that already, but what else do you know about me? Not much is my guess. Well this poor excuse for a webpage is about to change that.

<h3 class="headings">Early Life</h3>

<p class="text"> I was born and raised in Regina, SK. I am the youngest of 7 kids (I know, crazy right)
    Though I lived in the city I spent a lot of my time out at my uncle's ranch in southern sask. 
    I enjoyed the outdoors starting from a very early age. Hours were spent hiking through the grasslands and chasing wild kittens. Every Summer we went on camping trips 
    exploring different parts of Canadain nature(though never more that 10 hour drive from home, my parents hated long drives). As much fun as the camping in the praires was 
    the trips I remember the best and have the fondest memories of are all in the mountains.  </p>
